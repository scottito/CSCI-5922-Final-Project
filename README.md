# CSCI-5922-Final-Project
Scott Hardman and Owen Flack's Neural Networks and Deep Learning Final Project inspired by the CIBMTR - Equity in post-HCT Survival Predictions competition on Kaggle.

The primary motivation for our work is to achieve more accurate results when making predictions about the outcomes of patients after they undergo allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT). HCT is a medical procedure in which a patient receives blood-forming stem cells from a donor.

We propose a model that integrates wholistic patient data into our predictions. We seek to make predictions that are more accurate and more equitable taking into account patients' diverse backgrounds and conditions. We propose the creation of a deep learning model to do this since there are many studies of a similar nature with similar data.
